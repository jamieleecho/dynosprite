* The Coco has an unfortunate design defect which makes it impossible to
* read the state of the joystick axes without disrupting any currently
* playing audio waveform.  For this reason, Dynosprite supports 2 different
* audio playback methods, which have different qualities.
*
* Method 1: leave DAC output level at half-range
* - Pros: This method minimizes the amplitude of the audio disruption when
*         reading the joystick or starting or stopping audio playback.  It
*         will work best for games with continuous music.
* - Cons: This method works best with the digital joystick reading function
*         and will have more noise when used with the analog 4-bit or 6-bit
*         functions.  This method will produce a low-amplitude hum (regardless
*         of whether or not a sound is playing) when used on a real Coco but a
*         louder hum when run under the Vcc or MESS emulators, due to
*         inaccurate behaviors in the emulators.
*
* Method 2: leave DAC output level at minimum range
* - Pros: This method will have no humming signal if the audio is not currently
*         playing.  This method is best if you can ensure that the joystick
*         axes values will not be read while any sound is playing.
* - Cons: This method will produce significant noise if the joystick axes are
*         read while a sound is playing.  This method will also produce noise
*         (a step function) each time that the audio playback is started or
*         stopped.
